# Airplane-boarding-strategies
The most efficient way to board an airplane

Group project of 2018 IMA MATH-to-Industry Bootcamp

Compared different airplane boarding stratedies, such as back to front, rotating zones, WilMa, reverse pyramid, Steffen optimal method, and Modified steffen method, etc. Steffen optimal method is indeed the optimal, but its implementation requires strict order of boarding, not allowing pre-boarding or group boarding such as families. We modified the Steffen optimal method to include family effects. Besides, inspired by southwest's line ordering method, we proposed a feasible ordering strategy. After comparing with all other methods by considering several factors, our new method is the overall second best method. But we also allow preboarding, family groups, and a portion of passengers out of order. With improved boarding efficiency, the company's profit and passenger satisfaction are not affected. 

We also built a graphic user interface to generate the simulation of boarding process of different methods, which allows you to vary the input parameters and record the time it takes to board.
